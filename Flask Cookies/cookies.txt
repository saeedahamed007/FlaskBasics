The cookies are stored in the form of text files on the client's machine.Cookies are used to track the user's activities on the web and reflect some suggestions according to the user's choices to enhance the user's experience.

Cookies are set by the server on the client's machine which will be associated with the client's request to that particular server in all future 
transactions until the lifetime of the cookie expires or it is deleted by the specific web page on the server.

In flask, the cookies are associated with the Request object as the dictionary object of all the cookie variables and their values transmitted by the client.
Flask facilitates us to specify the expiry time, path, and the domain name of the website.

< --    response.setCookie(<title>, <content>, <expiry time>)  -- >

In Flask, the cookies are set on the response object by using the set_cookie() method on the response object. 

The response object can be formed by using the make_response() method in the view function.

In addition, we can read the cookies stored on the client's machine using the get() method of the cookies attribute associated with the Request object.

< --    request.cookies.get(<title>)     -- >
